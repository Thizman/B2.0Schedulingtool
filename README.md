## Installation

### currently only explained for Windows installation

#### Step 1: Install Python

1. **Download Python:**
   - Go to the Microsoft Store app
   - Search for ""Python""
   - install the newest version (version 3.13.12 as of the 9th of february 2026)

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - Open Command Prompt (Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter)
   - Type: `python --version`
   - You should see: `Python 3.x.x`

#### Step 2: Install Git

1. **Download Git:**
   - Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Click ""Git for Windows/x64 Setup""
   - Download will start automatically

2. **Run the Installer:**

#### Step 3: Install Visual Studio Code (Optional but Recommended)

1. **Download VS Code:**
   - Open the Microsoft Store app
   - Search for ""vscode""
   - Click ""install""
   - Note: having vscode installed is not strictly necessary, but if you want to view/edit the code, this is the easiest code editor (at least for me) to use
   - 

#### Step 4: Install PIL/Pillow (Python Image Library)

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

**Problem:** Double-clicking does nothing or shows an error

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Python installation:**
   ```
   python --version 
   ```

2. **Check if Python is in PATH:**
   - Windows: Open Command Prompt, type `python`
   - If it opens Microsoft Store, Python is not in PATH
   - Reinstall Python with ""Add to PATH"" checked

3. **Check file location:**
   - Make sure `scheduler.py` is in the correct folder
   - Check the path in your shortcut

4. **Run from terminal to see errors:**
   ```cmd
   python scheduler.py
   ```

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PIL'

**Problem:** Application crashes with PIL/Pillow error

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### Icon Not Showing

- Right-click shortcut → Properties → Change Icon
- Browse to `calendar.ico` in application folder
- Click OK, Apply, OK
- Refresh desktop (F5)

### Schedule Generation Fails

**Problem:** Clicking ""Generate Schedule"" shows an error

**Solutions:**
1. **Check CSV file format**
   - Ensure all required columns exist
   - Check column names match exactly
   - Verify shift codes (0930, 1030, 1300, 1530)
   - Ensure day codes (M1, TU1, W1, TH1, M2, TU2, W2, TH2)

2. **Check CSV values**
   - Hours must be numbers (not text)
   - Availability must be 1 or 0
   - No empty required fields

3. **Check total hours target**
   - Must be achievable with available people and desks
   - Reduce target if generation fails

### Export Fails

**Problem:** Export button does nothing or shows an error

**Solutions:**
1. **Generate schedule first**
   - You must generate before exporting

2. **Check file permissions**
   - Make sure you can write to the save location
   - Try saving to Desktop or Documents

3. **Check Pillow installation**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pillow
   ```

### Application Crashes

**Problem:** Application closes unexpectedly

**Solutions:**
1. **Run from terminal to see error:**
   ```
   python scheduler.py
   ```

2. **Check tkinter installation:**
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt install python3-tk`
   - **Mac:** Reinstall Python from python.org

3. **Update dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pillow
   ```

## Application Features

### Scheduling Algorithm

**Priority Order:**
1. Everyone gets at least one shift
2. Fill to preferred hours (can exceed target)
3. Meet total hours target if possible
4. Respect rigidity parameter for shift lengths
5. Use agreed hours tier if needed
6. Use max hours tier as last resort

**Hard Constraints:**
- Never exceed desk capacity per shift
- Never exceed maximum hours per person
- Never violate 2-hour minimum shift length
- Respect mandatory break (12:30-13:00)
- Enforce weekly variance limits

**Soft Preferences:**
- Prefer longer shifts when rigidity is high
- Balance hours across both weeks
- Distribute people evenly across days
- Minimize understaffing warnings

### Shift Structure

**Fixed Shifts:**
- **9:30-10:30** (1 hour) - Early morning
- **10:30-12:30** (2 hours) - Mid-morning
- **13:00-15:30** (2.5 hours) - Mid-afternoon
- **15:30-17:00** (1.5 hours) - Late afternoon

**Mandatory Break:**
- **12:30-13:00** (30 minutes)
- No one can work through this period
- If working morning + afternoon, shown as 2 separate blocks

**Common Combinations:**
- Full morning: 9:30-12:30 (3 hours)
- Full afternoon: 13:00-17:00 (4 hours)
- Full day: 9:30-12:30 + 13:00-17:00 (7 hours with break)
- Cross-break: 10:30-12:30 + 13:00-15:30 (4.5 hours with break)

### Color Scheme

**Interface:**
- Dark theme for reduced eye strain
- Orange accents for important elements
- Color-coded person blocks for easy identification

**Status Colors:**
- 🟢 Green: Good (target met)
- 🟠 Orange: Warning (below target)
- 🔴 Red: Critical (significantly below target or understaffed)
- 🟡 Yellow: Moderate warning (understaffed but manageable)

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Best Results:

1. **Ensure good availability:**
   - People should have availability for at least 2-3 days per week
   - Mix of morning and afternoon availability helps

2. **Set realistic targets:**
   - Total hours target should be achievable
   - Consider: (people × average hours) ≈ target

3. **Adjust rigidity based on needs:**
   - High rigidity: Fewer scheduling options but cleaner shifts
   - Low rigidity: More flexibility but potentially fragmented schedules

4. **Use weekly variance wisely:**
   - 0h: Perfect balance but harder to schedule
   - 1-2h: More flexibility, easier to meet targets

5. **Check warnings:**
   - Red warnings indicate critical understaffing
   - Try to resolve by adjusting availability or desk numbers

### CSV Preparation:

1. **Use provided samples as templates**
2. **Keep hours divisible by shift lengths** (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, etc.)
3. **Ensure preferred ≤ agreed ≤ max** for each person
4. **Double-check shift codes** (0930, 1030, 1315, 1530)
5. **Verify day codes** (M1, TU1, W1, TH1, M2, TU2, W2, TH2)
